# 👋 Hi, I’m @arshnoork-101

- 🌱 Right now, I'm immersing myself in the world of Full-Stack Web Development, expanding my knowledge in Database Management, and exploring the vast realm of Software Testing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects**, **web applications**, and **algorithm-based problems**.
- 😄 **Pronouns**: She/Her
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: Sometimes my code works like magic, and other times, it has a mind of its own! Crazy, isn't it? 🤷‍♀️
